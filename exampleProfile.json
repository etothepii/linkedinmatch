 "summary": "Ever since first being introduced to the Java language in 1995 at age 8 by my father I have been completely addicted to computers and how to leverage them in any way that I can. Having been brought up in a house filled with computers and mathematical puzzles I have developed a great love of solving mathematical problems of all kinds, whether leveraging computers or not. This passion allowed me to spot, and capitalise upon, the vast inefficiencies that existed in the various betting markets which I became interested in whilst at University and profited from during the first couple of years of my career.\

His is a team player, works well with both IT and the business, and is a strong developer. I would not hesitate in recommending James for any future Java or C# role, and hope to have the opportunity to work with him again. He has been an asset to our team at Barclays.","recommendationType":{"code":"colleague"},"recommender":{"firstName":"Dr. Kais","id":"pABpa8QlpK","lastName":"Dukes"}}]},"relatedProfileViews":{"_total":10,"values":[{"firstName":"Matthew","id":"8GxT0krF9J","lastName":"Shaer"},{"firstName":"Chris","id":"6MKwaBTN61","lastName":"Rusby"},{"firstName":"Hatim","id":"9xwYxHy8nO","lastName":"Gulamabbass"},{"firstName":"Dr. Kais","id":"pABpa8QlpK","lastName":"Dukes"},{"firstName":"Stephen","id":"pcYAhaNjbU","lastName":"Taylor"},{"firstName":"Vikas","id":"vEY1vQERe5","lastName":"Wadhwani"},{"firstName":"Michael","id":"SwO2n2fKBe","lastName":"Shalala"},{"firstName":"Rui","id":"U9yV8oGm1o","lastName":"Favas"},{"firstName":"Marius","id":"aQ2nYTfu12","lastName":"Filip"},{"firstName":"Sam","id":"6dubNVpsME","lastName":"Leveridge"}]},"relationToViewer":{"distance":0},"siteStandardProfileRequest":{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=194808765&authType=name&authToken=tQ3w&trk=api*a3314863*s3387333*"},"skills":{"_total":35,"values":[{"id":1,"skill":{"name":"Java"}},{"id":2,"skill":{"name":"C#"}},{"id":3,"skill":{"name":"WCF"}},{"id":4,"skill":{"name":"WPF"}},{"id":5,"skill":{"name":"Mathematics"}},{"id":6,"skill":{"name":"LaTeX"}},{"id":7,"skill":{"name":"XML"}},{"id":8,"skill":{"name":"Tx"}},{"id":16,"skill":{"name":"Derivatives"}},{"id":17,"skill":{"name":"Bloomberg Data License"}},{"id":18,"skill":{"name":"Bloomberg Terminal"}},{"id":19,"skill":{"name":"Equities"}},{"id":26,"skill":{"name":"Quantitative Finance"}},{"id":27,"skill":{"name":"Python"}},{"id":28,"skill":{"name":"Agile Methodologies"}},{"id":29,"skill":{"name":"C++"}},{"id":30,"skill":{"name":"SQL"}},{"id":31,"skill":{"name":"Machine Learning"}},{"id":32,"skill":{"name":"VBA"}},{"id":33,"skill":{"name":".NET"}},{"id":34,"skill":{"name":"Programming"}},{"id":35,"skill":{"name":"Microsoft SQL Server"}},{"id":36,"skill":{"name":"Trading"}},{"id":37,"skill":{"name":"Software Development"}},{"id":38,"skill":{"name":"Trading Systems"}},{"id":39,"skill":{"name":"Equity Derivatives"}},{"id":42,"skill":{"name":"Testing"}},{"id":43,"skill":{"name":"Credit Derivatives"}},{"id":44,"skill":{"name":"Test Driven Development"}},{"id":45,"skill":{"name":"OOP"}},{"id":46,"skill":{"name":"Fixed Income"}},{"id":47,"skill":{"name":"Algorithms"}},{"id":48,"skill":{"name":"Multithreading"}},{"id":49,"skill":{"name":"Object Oriented Design"}},{"id":50,"skill":{"name":"Design Patterns"}}]},"suggestions":{"toFollow":{"companies":{"_count":10,"_start":0,"values":[{"id":234080,"name":"DSR Corporation"},{"id":1979462,"name":"Cambridge Communication Systems Ltd"},{"id":873200,"name":"Tsuru Capital LLC"},{"id":8840,"name":"MERA"},{"id":995758,"name":"Artoo"},{"id":1323766,"name":"Museum of Mathematics"},{"id":21271,"name":"Quinity"},{"id":32526,"name":"The Product Engine"},{"id":221936,"name":"StackFrame, LLC"},{"id":866788,"name":"BTI360"}]},"industries":{"_total":0},"newsSources":{"_total":0},"people":{"_total":0}}},"summary":"Ever since first being introduced to the Java language in 1995 at age 8 by my father I have been completely addicted to computers and how to leverage them in any way that I can. Having been brought up in a house filled with computers and mathematical puzzles I have developed a great love of solving mathematical problems of all kinds, whether leveraging computers or not. This passion allowed me to spot, and capitalise upon, the vast inefficiencies that existed in the various betting markets which I became interested in whilst at University and profited from during the first couple of years of my career.

Since joining Barclays I have worked on a variety of projects within Barclays Asset Management. These projects have allowed me to substantially develop my natural aptitude for finance, mathematics and computing in a formal and collaborative format. Ultimately leading to my being selected to work on my current project, the highly sophisticated and powerful Archimedes back tester from its inception.","threeCurrentPositions":{"_total":1,"values":[{"company":{"id":1421,"industry":"Financial Services","name":"Barclays Capital","size":"10,001+ employees","ticker":"BARC","type":"Public Company"},"id":301194092,"isCurrent":true,"startDate":{"month":11,"year":2011},"summary":"Working in front-office technology at Funds & Advisory (the Asset Managemet Business of Barclays Capital with several $bn of assets under management).
