 "summary": "Ever since first being introduced to the Java language in 1995 at age 8 by my father I have been completely addicted to computers and how to leverage them in any way that I can. Having been brought up in a house filled with computers and mathematical puzzles I have developed a great love of solving mathematical problems of all kinds, whether leveraging computers or not. This passion allowed me to spot, and capitalise upon, the vast inefficiencies that existed in the various betting markets which I became interested in whilst at University and profited from during the first couple of years of my career.\

Since joining Barclays I have worked on a variety of projects within Barclays Asset Management. These projects have allowed me to substantially develop my natural aptitude for finance, mathematics and computing in a formal and collaborative format. Ultimately leading to my being selected to work on my current project, the highly sophisticated and powerful Archimedes back tester from its inception.",
